                                river.
                                The Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the
                                peopleliving near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell
                                so in
                                lovewith the rugged beauty of theriver that they never left.
                                Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and
                                bighorn sheep are also commonly sighted<br>.The river corridor is also lined with awe
                                inspiring
                                ponderosa pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and
                                provideshelter from sun or rain when needed.
                                Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of
                                the
                                longest undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water
                                is
                                higher, faster, and colder in the <br>countryearly summer and lower, slower, and<br>
                                warmer
                                in the
                                late summer. There are good rapids all summer...but families with children who
                                like
                                to

                                tend to appreciate the late summer's slower, warmer water more.

                        Winding <br>through canyons in central Utah, in some of <br>the most desolate land anywhere, the
                        Green
                        <br>river flows towards the mighty Colorado river<br> and the sea. High grey stone cliffs,
                        beautiful
                        <br>desert scenery, and great rapids have made this<br> run famous. This 84-mile trip runs from
                        from
                        <br>Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside<br> Green River Utah) and boasts outstanding

                        great
                        whitewater opportunities.

                        <br>Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually<br> done in 6 days

                        Desolation Canyon has been<br> recognized as a National Landmark. This desig<br>nation is based
                        on
                        the
                        uniqueness and rich history<br> that the canyon tells.

                                make one truly <br>unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only

                                exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins
                                accessible only by river.

                                CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the
                                Canyon
                                are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a widevariety of
                                rapids
                                and
                                river variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river
                                rating
                                scale, so we often refer to both.
